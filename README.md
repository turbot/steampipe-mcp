## Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steampipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@turbot/steampipe-mcp",
        "postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The default Steampipe database runs on port 9193 with username 'steampipe'. Adjust the connection string if you've configured Steampipe to use different settings.

## Local Development

To set up the project for local development:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mcp.git
cd steampipe-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```sh
npm run build
```

4. For development with auto-recompilation:
```sh
npm run watch
```

5. To test locally, ensure Steampipe is running and then:
```sh
node dist/index.js postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe
```

6. To use your local development version with Claude Desktop, update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steampipe": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/workspace/dist/index.js",
        "postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` with the absolute path to your local development directory. For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/steampipe-mcp`, you would use `~/src/steampipe-mcp/dist/index.js`.

## Testing with MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is helpful for testing and debugging. To test your local development version:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js
```
